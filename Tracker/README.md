This will start the tracking for each video file listed in config.ini and runs the correction at the end.
To use the program, type the following on the command line:

```
>> python main.py config.ini
```

With the tester you can look at how the tracking performs over time. To use the tester, type the following on the command line:

```
>> python tester.py config.ini
```

- config.ini can be used to change settings and video files.
- Also you can have multiple config files, config_mouse.ini:

```
>> python main.py config_mouse.ini
```
